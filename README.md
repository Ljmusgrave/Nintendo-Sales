# Nintendo-Sales
A web scraper designed to export sale info from nintendo.com to a csv file. 
Purpose is to allow user to find biggest discounts without needing to sort through every available promotion.

Once in csv file, this data can be opened in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to sort deals by % amount of discount, a feature not currently available directly through Nintendo's own website.
